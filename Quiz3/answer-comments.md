Q1: Search and Heuristics
- an admissible heauristics is a function in searching algorithms that never overestimates the cost to reach a goal.
- Yes a heuristic of "h=0" is admissable
- Yes a heuristic of "h=k" is admissable because it is always less than or equal to the cost.
- h = min(h1,h2,h3) may or may not be admissible. However taking the max: h = max(h1, h2, h3) is admissible.
