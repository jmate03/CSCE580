### 1. TC-identifier: 
TC-2

### 2. TC-name: 
Medium-Negative-Review

### 3. TC-objective: 
Check for if a negative sentiment can be predicted based on a more lengthy and not as straightforward review.

### 4. TC-input: 
The movie was not great. It had its ups and downs throughout but overall it failed to really hook me with the story. The soundtrack and visuals were nice but the acting left a lot to be desired. The story itself was bland and did not help with everything else considered. Overall would not recommend.


### 5. TC-reference-output: 
Negative

### 6. TC-harm-risk-info: 
HC2-opinion-manipulation

### 7. TC-other-info: 
This input uses several words with positive and negative connotations, but overall the sentiment is negative.
