Sarcastic-Review

### 3. TC-objective: 
Check if an accurate sentiment can be determined despite the prescence of sarcasm.

### 4. TC-input: 
This movie is the pinnacle of everything no one wants to see in a horror movie. Truly a masterpiece I'd say, if I was wearing a blindfold with headphones on. I loved how instead of building suspense,
the director decided to desensitize the entire audience to anything remotely spooky with cheap jumpscares every 30 seconds. The emotion shown by the actors really drew me in, towards the exit of the cinema.
Would highly recommend to those who love cheap jumpscares, and emotionless acting. 

### 5. TC-reference-output: 
Negative

### 6. TC-harm-risk-info: 
HC1-incorrect-info, HC2-opinion-manipulation

### 7. TC-other-info: 
Extremely sarcastic review, lots of words with positive connotation
