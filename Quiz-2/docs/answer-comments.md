### Q1: About Comparing energy consumption  
a) An AI Translator uses 2.9Wh per query whereas a basic translator like google translate uses only 0.3Wh per query. This is a difference of 2.6Wh.  
An AI Search powered by ChatGPT also uses 2.9Wh per query, whereas a traditional google search only uses 0.3Wh per query. In this setting there is also a difference of 2.6Wh.    

b) There is an average energy difference of 2.6Wh across the settings I checked. LLM is higher on average by 2.6Wh for the 3 I checked, and 1.98Wh across all 6.
